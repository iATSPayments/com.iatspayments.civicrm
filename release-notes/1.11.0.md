# iATS CiviCRM Extension 1.11.0

Sep 4, 2025

This release is a maintenance release for the 1.x series. 

It is recommended for all CiviCRM installs on 5.81 and above. 

It provides no new significant functionality, but it's a new minor version due to the potential for breaking earlier CiviCRM versions.
